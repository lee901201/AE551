<h3>R</h3>
<p>R programming is a popular computational tool for biological data analysis. In terms of Raman spectra, most time the number of wavenumbers that we want to look at is large, and the technique we apply is called multivariate data analysis. Comman tools we utilize include Least Square Support Vector Machines (LS-SVM), Cluster Analysis, Penalized Discriminant Analysis and Support Vector Machines.</p>
